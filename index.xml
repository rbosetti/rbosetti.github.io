      <description>While some people seek treatment for specific mental health conditions, it is not necessary to know or even meet criteria for a mental health diagnosis in order to benefit from therapy. I recognize that therapy is a very personal process and you are a complex human being. While I have the expertise to assess symptoms and provide appropriate diagnoses, I also go above and beyond to treat each client as an individual.</description>

      <description>Dr. Regina Lazarovich, Ph.D.  Licensed Clinical Psychologist in California (PSY&amp;hellip;) and New York (020676)
  I know that entering therapy can feel scary and vulnerable. I founded Compass CBT with the intention of providing a safe and non-judgmental space for the life-changing work of therapy. I approach each client with warmth, curiosity and respect. While some people know what they want from therapy, not everyone does, and thatâ€™s okay.</description>
