      <description>Dr. Regina Lazarovich, Ph.D.  Licensed Clinical Psychologist in California (PSY&amp;hellip;) and New York (020676)
  I know that entering therapy can feel vulnerable and scary. I founded Compass CBT with the intention of providing a safe and non-judgmental space for the challenging and life-changing work of therapy. I approach each client with warmth, curiosity, and respect. While some people know what they want from therapy, not everyone does, and that&amp;rsquo;s okay.</description>

      <description>Therapy is a very personal process and you are a complex human being, not just a collection of symptoms. In our early sessions I will conduct a thorough assessment in order to understand your social and cultural background, life experiences, circumstances, struggles and concerns. Together, we will set goals guided by your values and priorities, and I will devise a treatment plan to help you reach them. We will discuss the plan in detail; you will always know what we are doing and why.</description>
