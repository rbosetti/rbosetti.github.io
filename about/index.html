<p>I know that entering therapy can feel scary and vulnerable. I founded
Compass CBT with the intention of providing a safe and non-judgmental
space for the life-changing work of therapy. I approach each client
with warmth, curiosity and respect. While some people know what they
want from therapy, not everyone does, and that’s okay.  I collaborate
with each client to identify what matters most to them and design an
individualized treatment plan to alleviate suffering and enable
personal growth. During our work together I welcome your feedback, and
will actively monitor your progress and adjust the treatment plan as
needed. CBT is action-oriented. We will work together to take small,
comfortable steps to make larger changes in your life. This may
include learning and practicing skills and strategies during sessions,
reading assignments, and completing between-session exercises to
translate our sessions into real, long-lasting change.</p>

<p>I specialize in providing individual therapy to adults whose concerns include
but are not limited to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Chronic worry and anxiety about health, family, relationships, work, etc..</li>
<li>Experiencing panic attacks<br /></li>

<h2 id="training-and-qualifications">Training and Qualifications</h2>

<p>I graduated summa cum laude with a B.S.  in psychology from Brooklyn
College and earned my M.S. and Ph.D. in clinical psychology from
Hofstra University.  I completed my predoctoral internship at the
University of California, Davis and my postdoctoral fellowship at
Cognitive Behavioral Associates, a private practice in New York
City. My clinical work has spanned hospital, private practice,
community health center, and university counseling center
settings. Prior to founding Compass CBT, I spent five years working as
a staff psychologist at Williamsburg Therapy Group in New York City. I
have a comprehensive background in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT),
Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), and Dialectical Behavioral
Therapy (DBT). I have taught courses on Cognitive and Behavioral
Approaches to Counseling and Psychotherapy for the Mental Health
Counseling Program at Brooklyn College. I utilize evidence-based
practices in my clinical work, such as Exposure and Response
Prevention to address anxiety disorders such as panic disorder, social
anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. I approach eating and body
image concerns from the Health at Every Size® (HAES) and Intuitive
Eating perspectives.</p>
