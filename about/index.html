          <p>I know that entering therapy can feel scary and vulnerable. I founded
            Compass CBT with the intention of providing a safe and non-judgmental
            space for the life-changing work of therapy. I approach each client
            with warmth, curiosity and respect. While some people know what they
            want from therapy, not everyone does, and that’s okay.  I collaborate
            with each client to identify what matters most to them and design an
            individualized treatment plan to alleviate suffering and enable
            personal growth. During our work together I welcome your feedback, and
            will actively monitor your progress and adjust the treatment plan as
            needed. CBT is action-oriented. We will work together to take small,
            comfortable steps to make larger changes in your life. This may
            include learning and practicing skills and strategies during sessions,
            reading assignments, and completing between-session exercises to
            translate our sessions into real, long-lasting change.</p>

            <p>I specialize in providing individual therapy to adults whose concerns include

                <h2 id="training-and-qualifications">Training and Qualifications</h2>

                <p>I graduated summa cum laude with a B.S.  in psychology from Brooklyn
                  College and earned my M.S. and Ph.D. in clinical psychology from
                  Hofstra University.  I completed my predoctoral internship at the
                  University of California, Davis and my postdoctoral fellowship at
                  Cognitive Behavioral Associates, a private practice in New York
                  City. My clinical work has spanned hospital, private practice,
                  community health center, and university counseling center
                  settings. Prior to founding Compass CBT, I spent five years working as
                  a staff psychologist at Williamsburg Therapy Group in New York City. I
                  have a comprehensive background in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT),
                  Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), and Dialectical Behavioral
                  Therapy (DBT). I have taught courses on Cognitive and Behavioral
                  Approaches to Counseling and Psychotherapy for the Mental Health
                  Counseling Program at Brooklyn College. I utilize evidence-based
                  practices in my clinical work, such as Exposure and Response
                  Prevention to address anxiety disorders such as panic disorder, social
                  anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. I approach eating and body
                  image concerns from the Health at Every Size® (HAES) and Intuitive
                  Eating perspectives.</p>
